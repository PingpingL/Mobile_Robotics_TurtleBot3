# Mobile Robotics - Oogway
The goal of this project was to develop an autonomous reconnaissance robot, using TurtleBot3, to map and search for victims–simulated using AprilTags–in disaster-stricken areas, providing crucial information to human operators. We used GMapping for SLAM, OpenCV for people detection, and the explore lite and apriltag ROS packages for exploration and AprilTag detection, respectively.
